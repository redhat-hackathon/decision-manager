# Red Hat Decision Manager

## What is it?

Red Hat Decision Manager is a fast, lightweight, cloud-native business rules and decision management  platform. The platform enables developers and business users to develop rules and decision driven applications, services and systems in an agile and easy way. Example use-cases are: credit-scoring, fraud detection, premium calculation and law & regulatory compliance.

Leveraging the power of the open source project [Drools](https://www.drools.org/), the highly popular and de-facto open source rules engine, Red Hat Decision Manager delivers an enterprise class, high performance and scalable rules execution engine.
